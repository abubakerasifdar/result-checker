# result-checker
This program determines whether a student has passed or failed an exam based on their entered score (total marks or percentage). The system applies a standardized passing threshold of 40% or higherâ€”users who meet or exceed this benchmark receive a "Pass" notification, while scores below 40 trigger a "Fail" result.
